Using the roadmap feature
=========================

Pagure allows building the roadmap of the project using the tickets and
their tags.

The principal is as follow:

* All the ticket with the tag ``roadmap`` will show up on the roadmap page
* For each milestones defined in the settings of the project, the roadmap
will group tickets with the corresponding tag.
